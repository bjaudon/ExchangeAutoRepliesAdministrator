**Project Description**

Exchange Autoreplies Administrator is a GUI tool built in PowerShell that provides a front-end to the Get-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration and Set-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration cmdlets from the Exchange 2010/2013 Management Shell. 

This script provides an easy way for Helpdesk Personnel and System Administrators who do not like to use Command line tools to set a particular users' Out of Office status. It mimics the Automatic Replies dialog in Microsoft Outlook 2010/2013
